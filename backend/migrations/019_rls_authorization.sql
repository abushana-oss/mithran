-- ============================================================================
-- UPDATE AUTHORIZED_USERS TABLE POLICIES
-- ============================================================================

-- Drop old policies to avoid conflicts
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view authorized users" ON authorized_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authorized users can view authorized users" ON authorized_users;

-- Allow public read-only access to the authorized_users table.
-- This is required for the frontend to check if a user is allowed to sign up or sign in.
-- The table should not contain sensitive data.
CREATE POLICY "Public can view authorized users"
    ON authorized_users FOR SELECT
    TO public
    USING (true);

-- ============================================================================
-- NOTES
-- ============================================================================

-- How this works:
-- 1. User authenticates with Supabase (frontend)
-- 2. User tries to query any table (e.g., projects, vendors)
-- 3. RLS policy runs is_user_authorized() function
-- 4. Function checks if user's email is in authorized_users table and is_active = true
-- 5. If not authorized, query returns 0 rows / fails
-- 6. If authorized, normal RLS rules apply (user can only see their own data)

-- Benefits:
-- ✅ All authorization at database level
-- ✅ No backend code needed for authorization
-- ✅ Impossible to bypass (enforced by Postgres)
-- ✅ Works with frontend-only architecture

-- To authorize a user:
-- INSERT INTO authorized_users (email, full_name, role, is_active)
-- VALUES ('user@example.com', 'User Name', 'user', true);

-- To revoke access:
-- UPDATE authorized_users SET is_active = false WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
